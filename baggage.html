                    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Each passenger can only have a maximum of 6 extra baggage making a total of 8 check in bags. Each of the baggage is added on top of each other. For example if you have 3 extra baggage the total will come out to: 110+155+230 = $495 <strong> TIP:</strong> If you have more passengers with you, split the luggage, it will be cheaper. So if you are traveling with 2 other passengers then each person should purchase 1 extra piece each that way the total will come out to 110+110+110 = $330 instead.</p>
